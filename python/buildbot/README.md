# Notes for BuildBot
## Introduction
From Wikipedia:
> Buildbot is a software development continuous integration tool which automates the compile/test cycle required to validate changes to the project code base.
>
> It began as a light-weight alternative to the Mozilla project's Tinderbox, and is now used at Mozilla, Chromium, WebKit and many other projects.

## Implementation
Buildbot is written in Python on top of the Twisted libraries.

## Notice
Currently, BuildBot does not support Python 3 perfectly, so make sure to use Python 2.7
